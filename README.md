*Using JavaScript to build a playable piano can be a fun and challenging way to learn and improve your coding skills.
This blog will teach you How to Make A Virtual Playable PIANO in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch that can be played directly in a web browser.
If you donâ€™t know, a piano is a musical instrument that produces sound by striking a series of keys or notes on a keyboard. 
On my piano, users can play various tunes by clicking on the keys or using the keyboard keys. 
They can also adjust the volume and show or hide shortcut keys on the piano.*
